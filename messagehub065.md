# Why use the Kafka REST API?
{: #why_rest}

The Kafka REST API is a convenient interface that can be used in the following situations:  

* Where a developer wants to quickly get started using {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
* In certain low throughout use cases where latency is not a critical factor
* For debugging and fault finding

The Kafka REST API is not intended as a high throughput, low latency interface. For these types of requirement, we recommend using the Kafka API to connect to and from {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. For more information, see [Using a Kafka client](/docs/services/MessageHub/messagehub050.html#kafka_client).
