# How to use, download, and run the Liberty for Java sample
{: #liberty_sample}

The Liberty for Java sample implements a simple application that is deployed onto the Liberty runtime. The application uses the Kafka API for {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} to produce and consume messages.
The application also serves up a web front end that you can use for administration.

You can find the sample code in the [message-hub-samples GitHub project ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/message-hub-samples/tree/master/kafka-java-liberty-sample){:new_window}.
