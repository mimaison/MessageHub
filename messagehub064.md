# How to use, download, and run the Java Kafka API sample
{: #kafka_sample}


The Java&trade; Kafka API sample is an example producer and consumer that is written in Java, which directly uses the Kafka API. You can run this sample locally or in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}}.

The sample code is in the [message-hub-samples GitHub project ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/message-hub-samples/tree/master/kafka-java-console-sample){:new_window}. Although the sample uses
the Kafka API to send and receive messages, the sample uses the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} Administration API to create the topic it
sends messages to and receives messages from.

For more information about the setup and running of the sample, see the [README.md ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/message-hub-samples/tree/master/kafka-java-console-sample){:new_window}.

For a detailed walkthrough of how to run the sample, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}](/docs/services/MessageHub/index.html#getting_started_steps).
