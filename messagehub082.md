# MQ Light API samples
{: #mql_samples}


If you don't already have an app, try the {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API out with one of the samples.
{:shortdesc}

The sample app actually consists of two simple apps: a web front end that sends messages to a
back end and a back end that processes the messages, capitalizes the words, and then returns the
messages to the front end. This sample shows how easy it is to get apps talking to each other using
the {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API. You can also use the {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API to perform worker offload; a key capability
required for building scalable, loosely coupled, and distributed apps.

You can find the sample code in the [message-hub-samples GitHub project ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/message-hub-samples/tree/master/mqlight){:new_window}.
