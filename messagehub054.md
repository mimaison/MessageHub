# Why use the Kafka API?
{: #why_kafka}

There are a few reasons that you might choose to use the Kafka API over the other
interfaces provided by {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. 
{:shortdesc}

These reasons include the following:

* It is easier to integrate your app with existing systems that have Kafka support, for example {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}}.
* It offers lower latency and higher throughput than the other APIs.
* It offers a richer API than the Kafka REST API.
